This journal entry depicts von Dach’s encounter with the famed winged deer, native to remote parts of Abulia. The elusive beast is also a dangerous predator; it’s sharp, sabre-like teeth have incited fear and respect in generations of Abulians.

A folk myth, still whispered by the oldest citizens of Abulia into the ears of misbehaving children, warns against going out into the forest alone after dark. The winged deer are told to attack unsuspecting wanderers and suck them dry of blood. If you were to ever find yourself in the forest after night has fallen, your best chance of survival is to carry wild garlic with you—the deer are extremely allergic and once they smell the garlic on you, they will stay away.
