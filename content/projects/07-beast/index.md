The sketch depicts one of Abulia’s endemic species of lizard, with sharp horns crowning its head.

This page of the journal is unusually empty save for the sketch. It’s believed to be because the traumatic events associated with von Dach’s encounter with the horned lizard prevented him from ever returning to this entry.

The story, recounted elsewhere in the journal (on a page which remains with a private collector and was not made available for this exhibition), describes the dramatic events in which von Dach lost 4 of his crew members. The traveller and his party were attacked by a horde of horned lizards. As was later understood, while in mating season, the lizards become aggressive, and are triggered by the colour purple. Von Dach’s men were at the time protecting their heads from the sun with purple-coloured turbans; their fashion choices have cost them their lives.

This experience resonates widely in Abulia’s tradition and culture. To this day, high state officials wear purple headwear to public events to show they know no fear. 

Abulia’s 4th highest military honour is the Medal of the Horned Lizard.
