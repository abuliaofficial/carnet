First of the few remaining pages of the famous memoir and travelogue of the adventurer, writer and painter credited with introducing Abulia to the European audience.

The author recounts here, in imperfect, freshly-learnt Abülski, his first impressions of the unique land. His words written on this very page are believed by some experts to be the source of the well-known adage: _“It is not the destination that matters, but the journey”_.

Here we also find the first-ever written account of one of the myths which to this day remain at the very core of Abulia’s national identity and culture. Von Dach tells the story of the foundation of the Abulian nation from the pre-colonial times. Below is the transcript:

_“The dominant tribe of squirrels selected their kings by test. The elder would throw a golden key to the kingdom from the top of the highest tree. The squirrel which succeeded in finding the key became the next ruler. But one day, the key fell into the sea. The land was in danger as no squirrel could swim deep enough to retrieve the key from the bottom. But then, a penguin dove and brought the key back to the shore. After much deliberation among the elders, the squirrels crowned the penguin their king. The penguin is quoted to have said United, we are more together.”_

The story and the haunting words of wisdom have been immortalised in Abulia’s modern-day flag, coat of arms and motto.
