Von Dach travelled to Abulia, today a former colony whose territories were shared between the Swiss and Polish rule, in the 1840s. Modern history, biology and ethnography owe him much; his account of his travels, hand-drawn maps and sketches of Abulia’s unique fauna and flora creates a formerly unknown picture of the land, in von Dach’s words, _“abundant in the weird”_. 

It is in no small part due to von Dach’s praise, that Abulia became the country it is today, boasting the title of the **4th most popular tourist destination** in the region.

In von Dach’s time, Abulia was a land divided into nine semi-autonomous provinces. Today, the country has developed into a unitary democratic republic, whose political system is based on sortition, and, in case of a dispute, mud wrestling.
