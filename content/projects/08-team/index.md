This photo shows Abulia’s first national tug-of-war team in official uniform.

Second on the left (squatting) is Janüsch Froscht Trzerbra, jr., the great-grandfather of Abulia’s current Minister of Tourism, Traditional Medicine and Happiness, poet, and the inventor of the popular selfie stick (patent pending). 

The mannequin proudly presents a modern-day school sports uniform worn by schoolchildren across Abulia. The design is a modernised take on the original team uniform, which has had great influence over Abulia’s fashion to this day.
