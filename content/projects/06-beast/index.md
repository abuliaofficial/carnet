Known to Abulian zoologists under it’s technical name of “rhinocepig”, this wild beast and its place in Abulia’s mythology and culture enchanted von Dach during his travels. 

Here pictured from two different angles, the fine specimen sketched by von Dach might have been one of the very last wild horned pigs alive in Abulia. The species went extinct soon after. Researchers put the blame squarely on the popular folk tale, according to which rhinoce-pig’s bacon improved the performance in the bedroom. The animal were hunted to extinction by Abulian men eager to impress their wives.
