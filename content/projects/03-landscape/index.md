During his travels across Abulia, von Dach found himself at the roof of the land. His sketch immortalises the majestic peaks and deep emerald valleys of Abulia’s highest mountain range.
The journal entry (written in a much-improved Abülski) gives a short account of the traveller’s strange encounter with what he describes as “mountain creatures, monkey-like, but walking on two large, grasping feet, with a curious intelligence about them”. 
The sketch of the creature, featured on the journal’s next page over, would have provided invaluable evidence to researchers and scientists. Sadly the page is believed to have been lost in a tragic accident involving the Abulian Horned Lizard.
