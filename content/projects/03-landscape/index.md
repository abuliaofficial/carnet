One day, Von Dach rested under a tree in an Abulian orchard, when a pear fell on his head. While examining the bump on his forehead, he is widely believed to have invented a prototype of the modern-day selfies tick.

Today, Abulia is the worldâ€™s **4th biggest producer of pears and selfie sticks**. Nearly 12% of the population works in the selfie stick industry, and various accounts credit the invention with a large influx of tourists in recent years [citation needed].
